I am a norwegian PhD student at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I have a Masters degree awarded in 2020 in [Applied Physics and Mathematics](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mtfyma) with specialization in numerical optimization.

My main research interest is understanding how to utilize learning based methods in practical applications.
