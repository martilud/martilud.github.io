I am a norwegian PhD student at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I have a Masters degree in [Applied Physics and Mathematics](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mtfyma) awarded by NTNU in 2020.

My main research interest is understanding how to utilize learning based methods in practical applications.
