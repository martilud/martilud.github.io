My name is Martin Ludvigsen, and I am a PhD student at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).
This website both concerns both my academic work in terms of publications, talks and teaching, and my pseudo-academic work in terms of blogs and tutorials.
